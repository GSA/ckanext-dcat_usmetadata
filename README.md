# ckanext-dcat_usmetadata

This extension provides a react Admin UI for managing custom fields related to [DCAT-US Schema](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/)

## Dependencies

This module currently depends on the [USMetadata app](https://github.com/GSA/USMetadata) for server-side validation and rendering. 
Make sure it is enabled in CKAN's plugins.

## Installation

To install this package, activate CKAN virtualenv (e.g. "source /path/to/virtenv/bin/activate"), then run

```
(virtualenv) pip install -e git+https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-dcat_usmetadata@master#egg=ckanext-dcat_usmetadata
(virtualenv) python setup.py develop
```

In your CKAN .ini file add `dcat_usmetadata` to your enabled plugins:

`ckan.plugins = [YOUR PLUGINS HERE...] dcat_usmetadata`

## Testing

Run `make test` to run the tests locally inside a docker container

You need to have docker and docker-compose installed locally for the tests to run.

## CI and Testing Workaround

The circle setup uses docker-compose to run the inventory app in the root of this project. In order to access local changes to the extension they need to be committed and the commit hash should be used to update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-freeze.txt`, to ensure that the changes will be picked up in CI. Please do this as part of the PR process.

## Building the App

To build the app (from metadata-app/ directory):

* `$ yarn build`
* `$ rm ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/js/*`
* `$ rm ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/css/*`
* `$ rm ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/media/*`
* `$ cp build/static/js/* ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/js`
* `$ cp build/static/css/* ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/css`
* `$ cp build/static/media/* ../ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/public/media`

Now update `ckanext/dcat_usmetadata/templates/new-metadata.html` to reference the new bundles.

For example:

```
<div
  id="root"
  data-apiUrl="{{g.site_url}}/api/3/action/"
  data-apiKey="{{c.userobj.apikey}}"
  data-ownerOrg="{{request.params.get('group')}}"
  data-datasetId="{{request.params.get('datasetId') or ''}}"
></div>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.2cca9f24.chunk.css" type"text/css">
<script src="/js/2.89b84686.chunk.js"></script>
<script src="/js/main.84d1d3f2.chunk.js"></script>
<script src="/js/runtime-main.bfc1d45b.js"></script>
```

## Metadata App

The Metadata APP is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)-bootstrapped project.

To run the app use `make app-up`

### Development

We recommend using [cosmos](https://reactcosmos.org/) for development.

Run CKAN locally (`make up`) and get the Admin user's API Key. Add a test org for development purposes and get the id. Add these values to indicated place in `/metadata-app/src/index.js`.

Run `make app-cosmos` to start the cosmos server, which will watch the `metadata-app/src` directory for changes.
